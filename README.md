# 🚀 AIGURU – Your AI-Powered Career Mentor

**Built for the Bolt Hackathon 2025**

## 💡 About the Project

AIGURU was born out of a common challenge we — a group of passionate students — faced:  
**How do we reach our dream careers when there’s no clear roadmap?**

With overwhelming online content, scattered advice, and no structured plan, we knew students needed something better. That’s why we built **AIGURU** — an AI-powered career mentor designed to guide students with **step-by-step career roadmaps**, motivation, and intelligent guidance.
